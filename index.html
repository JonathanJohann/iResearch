								<h2>Welcome!</h2>
								<p>My name's Jonathan and I'm a 22 year old MIT grad student with a love
									for data science, machine learning, and investing. I really
									enjoy solving difficult problems in creative, clever ways and
									I hope that you find the projects I post insightful or helpful
									if you are looking for inspiration for your own projects.

								<h2>Data Science</h2>
								<p>The data science section will be a large assortment of different projects using
									some of the many different datasets available to us right now. You will notice
									analysis done on Kaggle datasets, datasets from my coursework at MIT, and more.

								<h2>Quantitative Research</h2>
								<p>In the QR section, I plan to do a little of my own digging into what can be done. More specifically,
									I intend to spend more time trying out different methods of portfolio optimization, identifying
									alpha decay, and so on as opposed to doing factor research.

								<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
								<p>In the machine learning portion, I will be taking a look at different algorithms
								and explaining them in my own words. The way that this differs from the data science
								tab is that this will be solely dedicated towards understanding an algorithm and perhaps
								a basic implementation. One may, however, see algorithms from this section start to be 
								incorporated in the data science section.</p>
