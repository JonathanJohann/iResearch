<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The field of data science is broad so I'm going to mainly try to focus on a few programming languages and stick to the more exciting analytics. The main languages that I'm going to be focusing on are Python and SQL with some R use. As you're going to see below, there are pro's and con's of each and I try to weave the strengths together to achieve the task at hand.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
	<li>SQL is not needed to read in these CSV files. I'll be using it to prepare for DB usage down the road in my career.</li>
	<li>There are a lot of things that you can do in R that you can't in Python. (i.e. prune trees) Until I find a cleaner method that enables R library access from Python, I'll be reading output from text files generated by R scripts. R scrips will be provided in the repo.</li>
</ul>

<h2>15.0621 Data Mining: Finding the Data and Models that Create Value: Fall 2016</h2>
<a href="https://sloanbid.mit.edu/resources/15.062.pdf">Course Syllabus</a>
<p>For Fall Semester 2016 at MIT, I decided to take Data Mining with Roy Welsch. While the course normally calls for using JMP PRO, I was provided the option of using Python. As a result, I've done most of my analysis in Python as an applied data science exercise.</p>

<p>This assignment involved basic visualization and exploratory data analysis (very basic, it was the first assignment in the class) of car sales and laptop sales data.</p>

<h2>A Collection of Data Science Take Home Challenges</h2>
<a href="http://datascientistjobinterview.com/">Reference Website</a>

<p>I personally love this guide to data science take home challenges. Often times, as aspiring data scientists, we're told to look at Kaggle and, as much I like Kaggle, I like how these Data Science challenges are short activities where you can wrap up your analysis faster. If you're a starting data scientist without a knack for sklearn and pandas, I'd definitely recommend starting with this!</p>

<h2>6.S085 Statistics for Research Projects: IAP 2015</h2>
<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~6.s085/">Reference Website</a>

<p>Although 6.S085 does not appear as if it will be offered this IAP for the winter of 2017, I feel strongly that these slides are very important for a researcher to know. As a result, I've decided to replicate many of the concepts in Jupyter Notebooks.</p>

<h2>Exploring Lending Club Data</h2>

<p>One of my friends pointed out that Lending Club makes some of their data publicly available so I decided to take a look around and see what I could find.</p>
