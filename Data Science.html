<h2>15.0621 Data Mining: Finding the Data and Models that Create Value: Fall 2016</h2>
<a href="https://sloanbid.mit.edu/resources/15.062.pdf">Course Syllabus</a>
<p>For Fall Semester 2016 at MIT, I decided to take Data Mining with Roy Welsch. While the course normally calls for using JMP PRO, I was provided the option of using Python. As a result, I've done most of my analysis in Python as an applied data science exercise.</p>

<p>This assignment involved basic visualization and exploratory data analysis (very basic, it was the first assignment in the class) of car sales and laptop sales data.</p>

<h2>A Collection of Data Science Take Home Challenges</h2>
<a href="http://datascientistjobinterview.com/">Reference Website</a>

<p>I personally love this guide to data science take home challenges. Often times, as aspiring data scientists, we're told to look at Kaggle and, as much I like Kaggle, I like how these Data Science challenges are short activities where you can wrap up your analysis faster. If you're a starting data scientist without a knack for sklearn and pandas, I'd definitely recommend starting with this!</p>

<h2>6.S085 Statistics for Research Projects: IAP 2015</h2>
<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~6.s085/">Reference Website</a>

<p>Although 6.S085 does not appear as if it will be offered this IAP for the winter of 2017, I feel strongly that these slides are very important for a researcher to know. As a result, I've decided to replicate many of the concepts in Jupyter Notebooks.</p>
