	<h2>15.0621 Data Mining: Finding the Data and Models that Create Value: Fall 2016</h2>
	<a href="https://sloanbid.mit.edu/resources/15.062.pdf">Course Syllabus</a>
	<p>For Fall Semester 2016 at MIT, I decided to take Data Mining with Roy Welsch. While the course normally calls for using JMP PRO, I was provided the option of using Python. As a result, I've done most of my analysis in Python as an applied data science exercise.</p>

	<p>This assignment involved basic visualization and exploratory data analysis (very basic, it was the first assignment in the class) of car sales and laptop sales data.</p>
