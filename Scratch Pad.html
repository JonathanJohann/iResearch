<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>To me, not everything is a project. Sometimes, I just like to test ideas or run my own 30-second experiments. Whether it's a skill I want to learn, an idea I want to use, or something I want to try out, I'll try to post it here.</p>
<p>Quick disclaimer: This isn't something I'm trying to present to people or impress people with. It's my own playground of thoughts and experiments. I like using this page as a way to keep it all in one place.</p>

<p>This may get moved later to the Quantitative Research section or the Data Science section. For now, I'm just playing around with BeautifulSoup4.</p>

<p>Found out about Quandl and it seemed pretty cool. Looks like there's a lot of interesting data to access from here. Just thought I'd explore a bit.</p>

<p>Just running through some beginning steps with SQLite3. Mainly using this to practice more sophisticated querying.</p>
