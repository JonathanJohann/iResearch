	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>To me, not everything is a project. Sometimes, I just like to test ideas or run my own 30-second experiments. Whether it's a skill I want to learn, an idea I want to use, or something I want to try out, I'll try to post it here.</p>
  <p>Quick disclaimer: This isn't something I'm trying to present to people or impress people with. It's my own playground of thoughts and experiments. I like using this page as a way to keep it all in one place.</p>
